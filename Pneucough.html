										<strong>Questions</strong></p>
										Why is pneumonia the desired topic used in Netlogo? Is pneumonia a contagious disease?</p>

										<strong>Setup of the Simulation</strong></p>

										<strong>Properties of the disease</strong></p>

										Exposure: 
										</p>A detailed history of possible exposures should be sought as it can help in establishing 
										the potential etiologies. </p>The following are some associations of exposures and etiologies of bacterial pneumonia:</p>

										Contaminated air-conditioning and water systems may cause Legionella pneumonia.
										Crowded places, such as jails, shelters, etc., expose a person to <em>Streptococcus pneumonia</em>, <em>Mycobacteria</em>, <em>Mycoplasma</em>, and <em>Chlamydia</em>.
										Exposures to several animals, such as cats, sheep, and cattle, may lead to infection with <em>Coxiella burnetii</em>
										Some birds, such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks, can expose a person to <em>Chlamydia psittaci</em>.</p>
										Risks of Aspiration:</p> Patients with an increased risk of aspiration are more prone to develop pneumonia secondary to aspiration. </p>Associated risks are:</p>

										<li>Altered mentation</li></p>
										<li>Drug abuse</li></p>
										<li>Dysphagia</li></p>
										<li>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</li></p>
										<li>Alcoholism</li></p>
										<li>Seizure disorder</li></p>
										Host mechanisms: </p>
											<p>It is of utmost importance to explore a detailed history to find clues towards 
										the etiology of pneumonia. For instance, a history of asthma, COPD, smoking, and immunocompromised 
										status can be indicative of H. influenzae infection. H influenza most commonly appears in the winter season. 
										Similarly, social, sexual, medication, and family history can all be useful in determining the cause of illness.</p>

										Features in the history of bacterial pneumonia may vary from indolent to fulminant. Clinical manifestation includes 
										both constitutional findings and findings due to damage to the lung and related tissue.</p> The following are significant history findings:</p>

										<li>Fever with tachycardia and/or chills and sweats.</li></p>
										<li>The cough may be either nonproductive or productive with mucoid, purulent, or blood-tinged sputum.</li></p>
										<li>Pleuritic chest pain if the pleura is involved.</li></p>
										<li>Shortness of breath with normal daily routine work.</li></p>
										<li>Other symptoms include fatigue, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia.</li></p>
										For unbeknownst reasons, the presence of rigors is more often indicative of pneumococcal pneumonia than other bacterial pathogens.</p>

										The presence of productive cough is the most common and significant presenting symptom. Some bacterial causes have particular manifestation, such as:</p>

										<em>S. pneumoniae</em> - Rust-colored sputum</p>
										<em>Pseudomonas, Hemophilus </em>- Green sputum</p>
										<em>Klebsiella</em> - Red currant-jelly sputum</p>
										<em>Anaerobes</em> - foul-smelling and bad-tasting sputum</p>
										Atypical pneumonia presents with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations, such as Legionella pneumonia, which often presents with altered mentation and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>

										Physical findings also vary from patient to patient and mainly depend on the severity of lung consolidation, 
										the type of organism, the extent of the infection, host factors, and the existence or nonexistence of pleural effusion.</p> The following are major clinical findings:</p>

										<li>Increased temperature (usually more than 38 C or 100.4 F)</li></p>
										<li>Decreased temperature (less than 35 C or 95 F)</li></p>
										<li>Increased respiratory rate (more than 18 breaths/min)</li></p>
										<li>Increased heart rate (more than 100/min)</li></p>
										<li>Bradycardia (less than 60/min)</li></p>
										<li>Cyanosis</li></p>
										<li>Percussion sounds vary from flat to dull.</li></p>
										<li>Tactile fremitus</li></p>
										<li>Crackles, rales, and bronchial breath sounds are heard on auscultation.</li></p>
										<li>Tracheal deviation</li></p>
										<li>Lymphadenopathy</li></p>
										<li>Pleural rub</li></p>
										<li>Egophony</li></p>
										<li>Confusion manifests earlier in older patients. A critically ill patient may present with sepsis or multi-organ failure.</li></p>

										Some examination findings are specific for certain etiologies, such as:</p>

										<li>Bradycardia - Legionella</li></p>
										<li>Dental illnesses - Anaerobes</li></p>
										<li>Impaired gag reflex - Aspiration pneumonia</li></p>
										<li>Cutaneous nodules - Nocardiosis</li></p>
										<li>Bullous myringitis - Mycoplasma</li></p>

										<strong>Discussions</strong></p>
										Pneumonia is a serious disease that can infect a person from inhaling from bacteria and viruses. It can infiltrate the host even with its functioning immune system. </p>
										Bacteria The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. This type of pneumonia 
										can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called <em>lobar pneumonia</em>.</p>

										Bacteria-like organisms <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other 
										types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.</p>

										Fungi This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people 
										who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings, and vary depending on geographic location.</p>

										Viruses Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in 
										children younger than 5. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But, in some cases, it can become serious.</p>

										<strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
										<ins>The chances of getting pneumonia can be substantially reduced.</ins></p>
										Get a flu shot every year to help prevent seasonal influenza. The flu is a common cause of pneumonia, so preventing the flu is a good way to reduce your risk of pneumonia. 
										In addition, those at risk can get vaccinated against <em>pneumococcal pneumonia</em>.</p>
										<ins>Anyone can get pneumonia.</ins></p>
										While some people are at higher risk than others, anyone can get pneumonia. 
										Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, wheezing, cough, chills, rapid breathing, chest pains, loss of appetite and malaise, or a general feeling of weakness or ill health.</p>
										<ins>Pneumonia can have more than 30 different causes.</ins></p>
										Many germs, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause pneumonia. Understanding the cause of pneumonia is important because pneumonia treatment depends on its cause.</p>
										<ins>It can be deadly.</ins></p>
										Pneumonia can be very serious and can cause death. Complications from pneumonia include respiratory failure, sepsis and lung abscess and 
										are more likely to affect older adults, young children, those with a weakened immune system and people with other medical problems.</p>
										<ins>Good health habits can fight pneumonia.</ins></p>
										Washing your hands, following a healthy diet, getting adequate rest, regularly exercising and not smoking are all habits 
										that can help you from getting sick from bacteria, viruses and other causes of respiratory illnesses. Good health habits also promote fast recovery when you do get sick.</p>
